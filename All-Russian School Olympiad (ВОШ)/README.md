## F.A.Q.
### What is it?

#### According to [Wikipedia](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%92%D1%81%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BF%D0%B8%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B0_%D1%88%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2), All-Russian School Olympiad is a system of annual subject Olympiads (A-RSO in following) for students in state, municipal and non-state educational organizations that implement general education programs

### Where do you get the problems from A-RSO?
1. [Sirius Courses](https://edu.sirius.online/#/contests_page/vos)
2. [Olympiada.ru](https://olimpiada.ru/activity/73/tasks/2021?class=10&year=2021)

### Filenames explained
The second letter represents level of problem:
1. M - Municipal stage
2. R - Regional Stage
3. F - Final stage
The final letter represents the number of the problem.
The bigger stage - the harder problems. The higher number of problem - the harder solution.
There's also School stage in Olympiad, but we're not going to review it.

### Programming languages and Big O
In A-RSO, there's no Big O complexity. It takes time of program performing in seconds or milliseconds.
That's why the best language for solving problems of A-RSO is C++. Though, you can use high-level languages for submitting solution, such as Python, it's likely that you can miss your score because of slow performance of high-leveled languages.
So, the best programming languages for solving problems of A-RSO are low-leveled ones, such as C-family programming languages. In this repo you'll find solutions written on C++.
